            <h2>2. Simulation vs Reality</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Simulation Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              While MockMarket provides a realistic simulation experience, there
              are important differences between simulated and real trading:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>No Real Money Risk:</strong> Losses in simulation do not
                affect your real finances
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Emotional Impact:</strong> Real trading involves
                psychological pressure not present in simulation
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Perfect Execution:</strong> Simulated orders execute
                instantly; real orders may face delays or partial fills
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Slippage:</strong> Real trades may execute at
                different prices than expected
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Transaction Costs:</strong> Real trading involves
                brokerage fees, taxes, and other costs
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Unlimited Virtual Capital:</strong> Real trading is
                limited by your actual financial resources
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Performance Differences</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Success in simulation does NOT guarantee success in real
                trading.
              </strong>{" "}
              Many traders who perform well in simulation struggle with real
              money due to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Emotional decision-making under financial pressure</li>
              <li>Impact of transaction costs on profitability</li>
              <li>Market conditions and liquidity constraints</li>
              <li>Risk management becomes critical with real money</li>

            <h2>3. Real-World Trading Risks</h2>
            <p>
              If you decide to engage in REAL trading after learning on
              MockMarket, be aware of these substantial risks:
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Market Risk</h3>
            <p>
              Stock prices can fluctuate dramatically due to economic
              conditions, political events, market sentiment, and
              company-specific news. You can lose your entire investment.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Volatility Risk</h3>
            <p>
              Stock prices can be extremely volatile, especially for small-cap
              stocks. Rapid price movements can result in substantial losses.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Liquidity Risk</h3>
            <p>
              Some securities may be difficult to sell quickly at a fair price.
              This can prevent you from exiting positions when desired.
            </p>

            <h3>3.4 Leverage Risk</h3>
            <p>
              Trading on margin or using leveraged products can result in losses
              exceeding your initial investment. Leverage magnifies both gains
              and losses.
            </p>
